# Love Me Not

Like a combination of the games 'hot potato' and 'press your luck'.<br>
Played by taking turns picking petals from a rose, the player to pick the last petal is cursed to 'never find love'.

## Approach & Overview

"Congratulations, you and a friend have picked a magical rose!
Unfortunately, this rose has a curse.
The conditions are like the childrens game:
"They love me, they love me not",
but with a dark twist.
This rose will curse the player who picks its very last petal - 
and that player will be doomed to never find love 
while the winner...won't be cursed.
You do not know how many petals the rose has.
You will take turns picking the petals from the rose before the game ends 
leaving one of you to be alone forever.
Each turn, you will have one chance to claim the amount of petals you will pick.
Once you click the rose, 
the amount of petals you have risked will be picked."

Using a combination of event listeners and randomization in jQuery with CSS animation, I created dynamtics to simulate visual and technical game play. 

## Instructions

- Once you hit start game at the bottom, the player to go first will be determined by the Rose's magic.
- First, you will risk eternal love by clicking start on the risk meter on the left
- Click stop to claim how many petals you'd like to pick, but be careful, you don't want to get the last petal!
- Next, test your luck while using your picks by clicking the rose on the right - and find out if your risk has paid off!
- The rose will then be passed to the next player where they will begin at the meter again.
- Pass the rose back and forth until one of you claims the reward of eternal love, and the other is given the curse of never finding love.
